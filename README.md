# Brain Tumor MRI Classification using ML Models
This repository contains the implementation of machine learning models for classifying brain tumor images from MRI scans. The goal is to predict whether an MRI scan shows the presence of a tumor, and if so, to classify the type of tumor.

Features:
Preprocessing: Includes image resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
Model Selection: Implements different machine learning models such as SVM, Random Forest, and CNN for classification.
Dataset: Utilizes publicly available brain tumor MRI datasets (such as the "Brain MRI Images for Brain Tumor Detection" dataset).
Evaluation: Provides evaluation metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualization: Displays training curves and confusion matrix for performance analysis.
